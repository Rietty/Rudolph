This repository consists of all my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com), a yearly programming challenge, made by [Eric Wastl](https://was.tl).

- All solutions in this repository are written in Python 3.13.
- I use the following packages for general quality:
  - [`ruff`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for for linting and formatting.
  - [`mypy`](https://github.com/python/mypy) for static typing enforcement.
